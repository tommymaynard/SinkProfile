# SinkProfile

The SinkProfile PowerShell module is based on some earlier PowerShell I wrote that was used to automatically sync a profile script, between my work and home computer over the Internet. Well, it's be greatly improved. Everything about it is fully discussed in [The PowerShell Conference Book](https://leanpub.com/powershell-conference-book). This book idea was designed in order to support [The DevOps Collective, Inc. OnRamp Scholarship](https://powershell.org/summit/summit-onramp/onramp-scholarship/). While you're welcome to the code, but do keep in mind that my chapter in this multi authored book will help break down and explain all the code in this PowerShell module. Grab a copy, read along, and let's better this code.
